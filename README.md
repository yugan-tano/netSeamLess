# netSeamLess
本项目的设计初衷：方便用户混合办公，能只带智能屏幕和键盘鼠标，即可远程获得台式机的性能（远程调用台式机）
未来发展方向：提供更广泛的连接功能，不只是移动端和服务器端的连接

现阶段进展：只是有一个想法，由于本人的平板是鸿蒙系统，现阶段使用浏览器网页作为客户端。
现阶段开发目标：提供适用于个人的远程方案，达到画面清晰、延迟极低的体验。下一步能够使用外设，扩展到更多设备上。
欢迎大家加入，扩展netSeamLess的连接功能，让它越来越强大。

本项目是开源项目，资金问题，暂时会是需要个人部署方案的方向。源码全部公开，欢迎任何拿来主义，也欢迎捐赠，欢迎贡献者。
欢迎感兴趣人士的交流。

1. Vision &amp; Design Philosophy This project is designed to facilitate hybrid work.The core idea is to enable users to carry only a lightweight device (like a smart screen) with a keyboard and mouse, yet remotely harness the full power of their high-performance desktop computer from anywhere.
2. Future Roadmap
We aim to evolve beyond simple mobile-to-desktop connections.Our future direction is to provide a broader ecosystem of connectivity, supporting a wider range of devices and seamless integration across platforms.

3. Current Status & Immediate Goals

· Current Stage: This project is currently in its conceptual and early development phase. As the primary developer uses a HarmonyOS tablet, the initial client is a web-based interface accessible through a browser.
· Development Focus: Our immediate goal is to build a personal remote access solution that delivers an exceptional user experience, characterized by crystal-clear video quality and ultra-low latency. The next milestone is to achieve robust peripheral device passthrough (e.g., keyboards, mice, and eventually specialized hardware), paving the way for expansion to more devices.

4. Call for Collaboration
We warmly welcome developers and enthusiasts to join us in expandingnetSeamLess's connectivity capabilities and helping it grow more powerful. Your contributions are invaluable.

5. Open Source & Funding Model
This is an open-source project.All source code is publicly available. We encourage "forking" and adoption for personal use. Given current funding constraints, the initial deployment model will require individual users to set up their own instances. Donations are greatly appreciated to support development, and contributor involvement is even more welcome.

We invite all interested individuals to connect and discuss potential collaborations.
